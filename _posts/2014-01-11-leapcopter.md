## Presented by Nick Nisi

{% include nicknisi.html %}

Nick combined aspects of the other two presentations at NebraskaJS January 2014 ([Leap Motion](/2014/leapmotion/) and a [nodecopter](/2014/hardware-geocities/)) to demo flying a [Parrot AR.Drone](http://ardrone2.parrot.com) using the [Leap Motion interactive controller](https://www.leapmotion.com/).

One of the really impressive pieces of this presentation was that Nick used [Node-DroneStream](https://github.com/bkw/node-dronestream) which uses [Broadway.js](https://github.com/mbebenita/Broadway) (a JavaScript H.264 decoder) to decode a live video stream from the Drone. This created a really fluid video.
