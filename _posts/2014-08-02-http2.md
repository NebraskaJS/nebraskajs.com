Back when HTTP was first written, we didn't know where the internet would go. We couldn't see the future. Looking back, what we've seen is consistent: it's growing at an accelerated rate. First, there's mobile, which [increases the size of the internet by 5x or 10x](http://ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2014/7/21/leverage). Today, we have the Internet of Things (or IoT), which is an entire new industry that looks like it'll grow to an even bigger scale. With all this stuff to think about, HTTP/2 tries to adapt the basic parts of how the internet works to a future that we can better see.
