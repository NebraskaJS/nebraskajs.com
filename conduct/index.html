		<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

		<p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our meetup are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.</p>

		<h2>tl;dr: Don’t be a Jerk</h2>

		<h2>Need Help?</h2>

		<p>Contact <a href="mailto:zachleatherman@gmail.com">Zach</a>, <a href="mailto:nick@nisi.org">Nick</a>, or one of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/nebraskajs/members/?op=leaders">other organizers</a> directly.</p>

		<h2>The Quick Version</h2>

		<p>Our meetup is dedicated to providing a harassment-free meetup experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of meetup participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any meetup venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Meetup participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the meetup <em>without a refund</em> at the discretion of the meetup organisers.</p>

		<h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>

		<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

		<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

		<p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.</p>

		<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the meetup organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the meetup with no refund.</p>

		<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of meetup staff immediately. meetup staff can be identified as they&#39;ll be wearing branded t-shirts.</p>

		<p>Meetup staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the meetup. We value your attendance.</p>

		<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at meetup and workshop venues and meetup-related social events.</p>
