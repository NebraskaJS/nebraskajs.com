# {{ page.title }}

Please take some time to read last year’s post entitled [Call for New Speakers](/2013/call-for-new-speakers/).

The time has come for **[another Lightning Round meetup](http://www.meetup.com/nebraskajs/events/181849992/)**. And in a NebraskaJS Lightning Round, we give preference to new speakers!

If you’re unsure what to talk about, below is a list of new technologies that would make for a great lightning talk! Don’t be afraid to pick something you don’t know! Sometimes the best explanations come from someone who just learned it.

 * `will-change`
 * Critical Path CSS
 * Flexbox
 * New iframe features: `sandbox`, `seamless`, `srcdoc`
 * Web Audio APIs
 * WebGL/three.js
 * Canvas
 * WebRTC Video
 * Web Components
 * Shadow DOM
 * Service Workers
 * `<picture>` / Responsive Images

This list is by no means comprehensive. If you have something else you’re passionate about, feel free to speak on a topic of your own choosing!
