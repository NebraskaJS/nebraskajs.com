In what was likely the [last event held at the What Cheer office](http://www.siliconprairienews.com/2013/03/i-live-in-omaha-creator-john-henry-mller-to-move-to-california), John Christopher gave a talk about Ember.js to a new NebraskaJS attendance record of 57 people.

> Ember.js touts itself as “A framework for creating ambitious web applications.” This talk will provide an ambitious introduction to Ember.js, covering the following:
> 
> * Philosophy behind Ember.js and why you might choose it over other frameworks.
> * Idioms used inside of Ember.js.
> * How to get started with it.
