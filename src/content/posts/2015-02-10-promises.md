* [Native promises browser support on Can I Use](http://caniuse.com/#feat=promises).  Only possible concern is using the `catch` on older versions of IE.  You can get around this by using strings to call catch, like : `somePromise['catch'](function...)`
* Question from Nick Makey:  Are Native Promises A+ compliant?  I still had trouble finding a definitive answer but the [polyfill](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise#readme) I mentioned in the talk is a subset of RSVP.js which is compliant.  Additionally there is a [native promises only](https://github.com/getify/native-promise-only) polyfill that is also A+ compliant.  I believe that should cover most cases.  
* Another question from Nick Makey:  What's wrong with Jquery Promises Exactly?  I didn't have a really detailed answer in the talk, but this [post](https://thewayofcode.wordpress.com/2013/01/22/javascript-promises-and-why-jquery-implementation-is-broken/) gives a good rundown and several examples.
