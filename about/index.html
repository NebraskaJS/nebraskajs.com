		<h2>About NebraskaJS</h2>
		<p>NebraskaJS was founded in fall of 2009 by local front-end heros <a href="https://twitter.com/jdsharp">Jonathan Sharp</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/amwirick">Andrew Wirick</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/eliperelman">Eli Perelman</a>. It was originally focused solely on jQuery, but later expanded to include other front end technologies.</p>
		<p>In 2012, group leadership duties were passed on to <a href="https://twitter.com/zachleat">Zach Leatherman</a> and the group decided to move away from a jQuery focus toward a more generic JavaScript (and front-end) focus. <a href="https://twitter.com/nicknisi">Nick Nisi</a> joined mid-2013 primarily to get more JavaScript developers to use Vim. In 2014, <a href="https://twitter.com/blainekasten">Blaine Kasten</a> joined to bring NebraskaJS to Lincoln.</p>
		<p>Our goals:
			<ul>
				<li>Encourage open source/community contributions by our members. A portion of every meeting is dedicated to small lightning talks on GitHub issues that members in the community have contributed to (no issue too small).</li>
				<li>Sharing workflow and useful tools. Small coding exercises dedicated to showing how others work can expose useful tips and tricks to separate the wheat from the chaff in development tooling.</li>
				<li>All presentations are recorded and published online, in the hopes that it will improve the quality of presentations and offer nice exposure and incentive to present.</li>
			</ul>
			We seek to bring together the developer and designer community in Nebraska and cover interesting topics relevant to front end web development. Come <a href="http://meetup.com/ReactJS-Denver/">join us</a> for an informative event and a great community!
		</p>
		<em>This is the group formerly known as Omaha jQuery Meetup (2009) and Omaha Front-End Web &amp; jQuery (2011).</em>
