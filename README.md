NebraskaJS
==========

Web site for Nebraska programmers dedicated to the JavaScript programming language.

### Building the Site

Use [NPM](http://npmjs.org) to install the dependencies.

    npm install

[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) is not available in npm, so you'll need to install it separately. Then, run the build script:

    grunt

Output is generated into the `_site` directory.  As is, the site's hierarchy (subfolders for posts) means that all of the resources are referenced using absolute urls and the site must be hosted at `/`. Set up a Virtual Host for the `_site` directory and modify your `/etc/hosts` to map that to a local development domain of your choosing.

#### Fetching Presenters

Add the new Presenterâ€™s twitter and github handles to `_presenters/presenters.json`

    grunt presenters
    grunt
